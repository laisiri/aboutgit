    Git is free open source destributes version control system designed
to handle everything from small to large project with speed and efficiency.
And git tracking changes files in working area (file in repository or folder).
It designed for coordinating work among teams.
    How to uses Git.
    1.Install Git and create Github accout.
    2.Create repository(folder) 
        
        mkdir (folder name)
    
    3.In repository or folder we make initialize repository with git init.
        
        git init
    
    4.In repository we will create file in it. If we need track file we must to tracking  file and staging with command 
       git add  

    5.When we edit file that we add. We must commit and append message when we commit.

        git commit -m "your message about commit"

    6.Create New Branch
      Now that you've made a new commit let's try something a little more advanced.
      Say you want to making changes to the main project while developing the feature.
      This is where git branches come in. Branches allow you to move back and forth
      between 'states' of a project. For instance,if you want to add a new page to your website 
      you can create a new branch just for that page without affecting the main part
      of the project. Once you're done with the page,you can merge your changes from your branch
      from your branch in to primary branch. When you create a new branch,Git keep track of which commit your branch 'branched'
      off of,so it knows the history behind all the files.
